# GroceryStore
This project will showcase interesting features of the Eiffel programming language, including inheritance with OOP.
Eiffel also has "design by contract" https://www.eiffel.org/doc/eiffel/ET-_Design_by_Contract_%28tm%29%2C_Assertions_and_Exceptions 
The third feature will be using is that Eiffel is an imperative language

We can design a store, where there are different types of items, where there are certain things characteristics that the items share (e.g. all "dairy" products have milk and need to be refrigerated)
Then the main program can be grocery shopping, maybe an aisle generator for lists, or allergy friendly shopping
