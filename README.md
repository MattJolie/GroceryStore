# Term Project
This project will showcase interesting features of the Eiffel programming language, including inheritance with OOP.
Eiffel also has "design by contract" https://www.eiffel.org/doc/eiffel/ET-_Design_by_Contract_%28tm%29%2C_Assertions_and_Exceptions 
The third feature will be using is that Eiffel is an imperative language
We need to include multiple inheritance

Making a company designer. The back end can have certian properties for different types of employees. The multiple inheritance can come from their position and also work role. For example, an employee can be an executive, and also be a hybrid employee. Executive employees can have properties like salary, vacation days, etc compared to other types of employees (management, hourly, etc). While hybird employees have different in office days, and other traits when compared to remote or in-person employees.
Our demonstration can allow people to add new employees on top of a defautl list, and we can display a company hierarchy tree for a graphical component.
